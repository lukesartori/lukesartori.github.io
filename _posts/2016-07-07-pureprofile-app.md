post_intro: Built on the philosophy 'why guess, when you can ask?', Pureprofile asks consumers thousands of questions and turns these answers into rich, transparent profiles of real people, providing them back real insights and value in the process. This mantra provided the brief and direction for designing a mobile application that would allow consumers to build a personal profile from multiple sources of data while on a mobile device.

### Problem

Our biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the process of answering questions on a regular basis quick, easy, and fun. We were also interested in how to utilize the mobile device to provide more value for a user by building out their profile by answering questions automatically – like using GPS to fill in the answer to ‘Where am i right now?’. Creating an engaging, but habit forming, way to do this on a mobile device was our main goal throughout the design process.

### Audience

The user base for the app was split into two groups, defined by their primary motivations for using Pureprofile. One group of users were motivated primarily by being paid to answer questions. This group consisted largely of members who have been with Pureprofile for awhile and were traditionally accustomed to taking part in online market research surveys.

The second group of users were motivated by exchanging their profile data for premium content such as news articles or Spotify and Netflix subscriptions. These users formed part of a wider marketing acquisition strategy to help grow the Pureprofile member base.

### Constraints

The app had to accommodate all of the core features the existing desktop experience had. Users would have a personalized feed of content and questions, a history timeline to view their historical activity, a redemption system to redeem the money they earn and way of proactively building out their personal profile and viewing the insights attached to this. This needed to be re-imagined for mobile and as such the user journeys and use cases would result in a new experience for Pureprofile members.

### My role/The team

The product team consisted of myself, a visual designer, a product manager, and two developers, with occasional input and support from copy writers, and the marketing dept. Our CEO was a main driver for specifications and his vision for the app helped to ensure the design concepts encapsulated all the business requirements.

The UX deliverables produced included:
* Personas
* User journeys
* Wireframes
* UI flows
* Prototypes

### Design Process

I spent a lot of time working with a range of stakeholders to truly understand the value propositions for both user groups and ensure their needs were properly met. I worked on the persona’s with our marketing department to understand the key demographics and how this would tie in with our acquisition strategy. Our value propositions fell into 4 categories:

1. Connecting with brands to help shape products and services
2. Personalized content based on their interests
3. Product recommendations and offers
4. Earn rewards for sharing their opinions

I created prototypes for each version/concept with the mobile prototyping tool Flinto. I liked Flinto as it allowed us to test natively with ease on the iPhone using a mock application. The animations and transitions were imitative of those used in iOS and we were able to quickly share these within the team and with users to get feedback.

The app centered around a feed of content that would be personalized and displayed based on the user’s unique personal profile. By interacting with the feed and answering questions, the content and brand interactions would become more relevant. Instead of diving straight into the individual tiles, we created a paper prototype to try and simulate how our feed would feel in use and what the feedback and interaction touch points would be.

#### Structuring the content

With many different types of content available in the feed, I developed 3 broad categories to differentiate content: brand interactions (surveys), content (social, videos, articles) and profile (updates and questions), with each of these categories having paid and free variants.

#### Feed tile UI

This content structure provided a framework for myself and also the other designers to start building out the UI and thinking about the information architecture and visual layouts. I created some wireframes and mockups to experiment with layouts and interface ideas.

#### Creating a feedback loop

Our solution for enabling users to proactively add meaningful data to their profiles focused on their ‘Intentions’ (buy something, go somewhere, do something etc.). We devised a set of actions that would allow the user to add an intention to their profile at anytime. This would trigger a follow up set of tiles that would appear in the user’s feed and perpetuate the profile building process. For example, if a user wished to purchase a new car, the system would store this intention and know to trigger appropriate recommendations, reviews and offers to the user and if a time frame was entered, would be actioned when scheduling the post.

#### Making it easier

Traditional online market research is cluttered with radio buttons, complicated matrix questions and lots of lengthy free text responses; all of which can translate to a frustrating experience on mobile. I approached each element of the controls individually and leveraged the touch gestures mobile provides to help improve the answering process. I wanted every question control to have the ability to be answered within two taps and ideally only require the user’s thumb to touch or swipe through options.
