### Problem

>How do we create a more personalised experience for visitors to the site and help them find what they are after efficiently, while showing off the Samsung brand and product offering?

User research showed that most customers wanted a clear path to all products beyond the ‘latest and greatest’ featured on the homepage. The old homepage was very product focused driven by new product launches and a skew to showcasing their mobile devices.

Analytics helped paint a clearer picture showing that 20% of all site visits included a view of the homepage (60% of those from mobile devices). When on the homepage, only 6.5% of visitors clicked the body content with most customers immediately using the global navigation or search field to dive deeper into the site. Customers are clearly on a mission to find what they are after.

After analysing the research, the team at R/GA proposed a shift to a more personalised experience for the user by displaying a collection of brand and product stories that showcase the breadth of Samsung’s product family. This approach would consider the customers needs and wants where possible and deliver a more relevant experience and help them find what they are after and drive them deeper into the site. Personalisation would be achieved by tapping into available browser based data and using this to generate a content offering matched to the customer profile.

### My role/ The team

I provided lead user experience support, working remotely with the other team members based out of NYC. I was responsible for conceptualising and executing all XD deliverables for this piece of the website redesign.

Communication primarily over Slack and Skype and of course email. This always creates some challenges but on the plus side it provide me the quite and focus you sometimes lose in an office with the inevitable day to day interruptions.

I presented to the whole team once a week to keep everyone in the loop on the direction I was taking and received feedback and client updates in turn.

### Audience

Samsung had defined the target user types so we had a solid basis of who we needed to design for. Users were broken up into 3 types; Non Owners, Loyal Owners and At Risk Owners. The homepage would aim to accomplish a seperate high level goal for each distinct user type:

![User's and goals](/images/samsung/user-diagram.jpg)

1. **Non-Owners**
	 _Purchase_: Help convert new customers and encourage them to buy Samsung.

2. **Loyal Owners**
	_Experience and Advocate_: Provide product support and education and encourage a repeat purchase relationship through product and brand stories.

3. **At Risk Owners**
	_Bond and Retain_: Extend the existing product experience by highlighting complimentary products from Samsung’s catalogue and educate on how to get the most out of their devices.

### Constraints

Creating a personalised experience for a person rely’s heavily on one obvious thing – That you something useful about them. Our challenge was to utilise a combination of browser based data signals and cookie information along with a 3rd party DMP data package to identify a user type and then use these data signals to personalise their experience on the homepage.

A major constraint was identifying which data signals would be the most valuable to enabling personalisation. We evaluated the available signals by understanding which ones were simple to implement but would also produce a consistent positive result. We also made sure to allow for some flexibility for more advanced signals in future updates.

I was very concious of the dev effort required to actually build this system and always had this at the front of mind when evaluating the data signals. Being realistic about the project timeline meant we had to work to compromise a little to meet the milestones and launch dates set by the client while still ensuring we stayed true to the vision and delivered a great product.

### Design Process

#### Who, What, How? Identifying users.

After careful consideration we selected the data signals that would shape the personalisation for the initial release. These included:

![Data signals](/images/samsung/V1-signals.jpg)

* Device type/environment – Mobile or Desktop
* Device Kind – Is the visitor using a Samsung device?
* Account – Has the user registered an account?
* Visit recency – People who haven’t visited in more than 6 months might get shown new and popular content
* Referrals – Incoming traffic
* Pages visited – Have they viewed product pages on S.com previously? If so, which ones?
* Sites visited (categorised) – Using third party DMP to group a user’s browsing history into digestible topics like technology, news or sport

Once we had these data points locked in I set about creating a framework that would determine what content and format is shown to a particular user type based on their available data signals. The framework had to be scalable to allow for future growth and flexible in defining what kinds of data signals can be used.

Firstly I decided to create some basic rule sets for each data signal type. Each rule would have a set of values that would trigger an appropriate content/UI response.

![Data signal rules](/images/samsung/signal-rules.jpg)

I sketched out a decision flow diagram which allowed me to map every touch point and outcome in a very efficient way. Visualising it like this helped define possible user scenarios, allowing me to play around and swap out different rulesets and values and test the structure to see if it would hold up different and use cases.

Each decision path would lead to a defined UI component response. Each UI component would have a single purpose and content strategy but would work together to unite the page in a common message.

#### Modular Building Blocks - Creating agnostic UI components.

Now we had a proven way to deliver personalisation, I started to look at how exactly this could be delivered from a responsive interface. We already knew a big chuck of homepage visitors were viewing from a mobile device so this was the focus when thinking all things UI.

Samsung provided us with their requirements for what the homepage would need to achieve. These focused around four core areas. After discussing internally we agreed that each of the four requirements would have its own UI component.

![UI master components](/images/samsung/component-master.jpg)

* __Campaign__: Showcase new product launches.
* __Product Ecosystem__: Highlight products and related product categories.
* __Brand Ecosystem__: Promote the Samsung brand and media initiatives.
* __Onboarding__: Provide a quick route to relevant education and product support.

When selecting interface elements I referred to some of the insights taken from A/B testing Samsung had conducted on their current site:

* Clustering content increased engagement on all devices
* Over 90% of desktop engagement occurred within the first content cluster
* Only 3% of visitors scrolled right or left

I designed each component to be relatively static and avoided using content scrollers, tabbed sections or slideshows. I clustered each content piece into a grid format for readability and quick scanning and made CTA’s clear and easy to action. By keeping each of the layouts modular and content agnostic, it gave the marketing and content teams a lot of flexibility to craft a wide range brand stories and select appropriate products for each targeted user type.
