### Inspiration

This was a personal project I completed with the help of my Dad. I had the vision and the design – he had the workshop and the tools. Together we designed and built a very bespoke piece of furniture for my apartment and we had a lot of fun doing it.
Inspiration

I love Danish furniture and Scandinavian design styles so these helped form the initial inspiration for look of the unit. I had inherited a Danish sideboard from my grandparents and took some aesthetic cues from it and other examples and incorporated these into the design concepts.

I had salvaged a large 1200 x 600mm slab of timber years earlier, made from a range of different coloured hardwood layers laminated together. I knew it had potential for something cool and it wasn’t until I was shopping for a new entertainment unit that I connected the two ideas.

### Design Process

I sketched a few ideas and opted to keep things very geometric and hard edged, a common feature of a lot of Scandinavian furniture. The unit had to accommodate a range of HiFi and AV equipment that I currently owned but also be flexible enough to take any new additions in the future. I created some basic orthographic views and dimensions based on the equipment sizes, keeping in mind the effect on the viewing height of the TV.

Considering the sizes and the materials I had to play with, I split the unit evenly to create two equal compartments. One side would feature a single shelf, effectively creating three areas of storage and display. Most of the sideboards I was referencing for design inspiration had doors on the front, which in most cases become the focal point of the piece. I decided to keep the front of the unit open and without doors, primarily to allow for the ventilation of equipment inside. I also wanted to show off the design of the amplifiers and equipment sitting in the unit instead of hiding them behind a door.

### The Build

#### Cutting and Modifying

We started off by cutting the slab in two, creating two 1200 × 300mm pieces. One half would be used for the top of the unit , dividing the other half into four 300 × 300mm pieces for the ends and center divider (plus one spare). We bought some lengths of pine for the base and leg frame and a sheet of plywood for the back of the unit. The legs were premade square tapered and fitted with angled mounting brackets.

After cutting all the pieces to size, we drilled the pilot holes and screwed the pieces together to get a feel for how it all sat, allowing us to make modifications and adjust any bits that weren’t sitting right. On the right side compartment, we drilled multiple holes at even intervals and used removable shelf pegs so the shelf could be adjustable depending on what equipment was to go in there.

#### Finishing

I wanted to avoid a glossy lacquered finish, opting instead to keep it traditional and went with an oiled finish to bring out the best in the hardwood. One of the challenges was trying to find the right stain for the plywood pieces to match to the color of the oiled hardwood. The result was finally achieved after concocting a mix of three different timber stains.

### Wrap up

Both Dad and I were super happy with the end result. The finish came out great and the stain matching was as close as it could be. It never fails to get a mention when people drop by for a visit and see it for the first time. I get the most enjoyment when they inevitably ask “Where did you buy it from?”.
