post_intro: While working with Pureprofile, we partnered with News Corp Australia to deliver a new way for readers to gain access to pay-walled content in exchange for providing their feedback and opinions.

### Problem
With only a small percentage of their readership paying for content subscriptions, News Corp (NC) were looking for a way to tap in to the rest of their readers who frequently hit the pay wall when reading articles on their masthead news sites. Pureprofile presented their core platform which allows users to be rewarded for providing their opinions via activities such as short targeted surveys, videos, polls and other media.

NC saw the value in this data and the potential to gain insights into their readers while also growing their customer base. This would also provide an engaging way for readers to get access to the content they are interested in without having to pay using the traditional subscription model.

### Audience

The readers were identified by the news masthead/site they predominately visit. News Corp Australia wanted to target readers across their main metropolitan news papers including: The Daily Telegraph (New South Wales), The Herald Sun (Victoria), The Courier Mail (Queensland) and The Advertiser (South Australia). These readers were further segmented across an even demographic makeup reflective of the ABS statistics.

As this was a new implementation, NC opted to trial it to a small pilot group of approximately 150,000 readers across all of the mastheads. Users would be identified by a combination of their cookie id, browsing history and their subscription status (no paid subscriptions).

### Constraints

News Corp’s project timeline was reasonably tight and we had 3 months to deliver the first version. This required the design phase to be accelerated and a lean approach to UX and visual design was applied in order to achieve this.

We also had to work with and accommodate the integration with NC’s existing user authentication and publishing systems. This was more a technical constraint but would have some effect on the end user experience.

#### Product scope

The product scope for this project involved two main pieces; An embed account widget that would have dedicated placement on each newspapers website, visible to those with a valid cookie. The second piece was a responsive site that had a feed of activities for users to complete, subscription renewal and account management functionality.

### My role/The team

I was involved in the initial specification and requirements gathering, working with our CEO, and project managers. My first deliverables were to help flush out the end user requirements and any pain points that might occur with the integration into NC’s systems. This provided the dev team with the goals and end user needs up front so they could factor this into their own planning.

The team for this project included myself, handling all UX requirements, a Senior Visual designer, project managers, and a development team of around 4 engineers that scaled up or down depending on the expertise required.

### Design Process

#### Requirements definition and planning

I produced a series of user flow diagrams to get a better understanding where any pain points might occur for users as multiple systems interact with each other. By mapping this out we found that there were multiple user scenarios for sign up/login and that the flows were not as straight forward as first thought. Identifying this early on was a huge win and was presented to the dev team during sprint planning and we were able to discuss the best approach together, ensuring all bases were covered.

#### Protoyping and testing

Once the initial specifications were established and user flows were approved i moved to wire framing the application along with low fi mockups and an Invision prototype to help communicate the concept to the visual design team. The prototypes were extremely useful in getting all the different stakeholders on one page and being able to test different UI layouts and interactions. We made at several iterations to flow and UI that would not have been discovered had we not tested the prototype and mapped out each user flow.

#### Bringing it together

After the wireframes and low fidelity prototype were signed off, our visual designer built on top of the wires and created a UI theme in line with NewsCorp’s brand guidelines. A high fidelity prototype was produced in invision to present to the News Corp team.

Design iterations based on client feedback were made until the final screens were signed off for release. I continued to work closely on the visual designers, and copywriters to achieve consistency in messaging and ensure that the core UI patterns were maintained.

My role also included user acceptance testing of the dev environment and providing feedback to the engineers. At times i would create some extra definition or diagraming around issues. I found that spending 30mins creating a quick mockup or flow diagram would be super useful in eliminating any confusion and helping the wider steam have more focused conversations on the specific issue at hand.

### Wrap up
News Connect launched in May 2015 and saw active logins rise week on week. To date, the service has acquired more than 20,000 active users and this is continuing to grow at a fast rate. News Connect users have provided over 2.2 Million answers to questions asked in micro surveys and polls both from their Mobile devices and desktop computers. This has confirmed the assumption that people will provide their personal opinions in return for free content access with over 42,000 online subscriptions redeemed so far.
