<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>The current system used by the team was clunky. Plagued by both an outdated technology stack and UI/UX, this system was starting to restrict the teams’s capacity for delivery and affect the output of client projects. With an expanding sales team and a growing list of clients, an overhaul of the system was in desperate need.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pp-platform/pp-platform-mockup2.jpg" alt="Pureprofie platfrom in use" /></p>

<p>To achieve this, the in-house suite of tools used to facilitate these interactions would be upgraded and expanded with new products and functionality in order to improve the speed and intelligence users will have when creating a customer-targeted interaction. These new products would be powered by a brand new technology stack and set of API’s that would ensure the scalability of the system in the future.</p>

<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>

<p>The platform would be used primarily by the in-house team of account managers, and sale and delivery consultants. Clients would also need to access the platform for reporting, to view dashboards and download data files. The platform had to accommodate multiple user types who all have various levels of understanding and domain knowledge of the processes and workflows. I spoke with both groups of users and applied their feedback to create user personas that would highlight the main motivations and goals of each user to better prioritize features.</p>

<h3 id="my-rolethe-team">My role/The team</h3>

<p>I was tasked with handling the UX requirements, with the rest of the team consisting of developers based in both Sydney and Greece, project managers, and a visual designer.I worked closely with our founder to extract his vision and thinking to establish a core feature list and gain a clearer understanding of where our product would be placed in the market.
I made myself a point of contact for the developers to help ensure the product vision was executed as it was intended and maintain our UX goals across the product. My main outputs for this project included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personas/Scenarios</li>
  <li>User journeys</li>
  <li>Wireframes</li>
  <li>UI flows</li>
  <li>Prototypes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="design-process">Design process</h3>

<p>Working from various concepts and prototypes, and using specific user feedback from our internal team and small pilot group of clients, I combined a set of existing must-have features with some new ideas and solutions we had developed from our research and design exploration.</p>

<p>My main focuses were on:</p>

<h4 id="how-information-and-elements-were-organised-within-the-ui">How information and elements were organised within the UI</h4>

<p>I wanted to create an interface that felt fast and fluid to the user in response to feedback which had highlighted that the current site seemed ‘clunky’ and static. User feedback told us that having the ability to scan pages for information quickly and know what is going on at any moment was key. I focused on creating an information hierarchy that was consistent across the entire product and surfaced important information so it appeared front and centre, allowing users to avoid hunting and clicking. I experimented with the overall size of the UI elements and decided on a larger size for buttons, icons etc. User research uncovered that the majority of users are viewing the platform on a second widescreen monitor so it made sense to make the most of the screen real estate on hand.</p>

<h4 id="navigation-and-moving-people-around-efficiently">Navigation and moving people around efficiently</h4>

<p>Each app has its own sub level menus, but a solution was required that would enable users to move quickly between apps and databases – a crucial component of their workflow.
I wanted users to be able move around to almost anywhere in no more than two clicks. To achieve this, I designed a quick jump menu that was consistent across each app, enabling a user to switch back and forth as they wished. I built an Invision prototype to test the concept and get a better feel for the position and size of the UI elements and overall layout.
This was also helpful in presenting the concept to the development team and describing the user journey along with the UI flow diagrams.</p>

<h4 id="surveyquestionnaire-builder">Survey/questionnaire builder</h4>

<p>One of the main features of the system was a campaigns application which featured a survey builder, similar to competition products like Poll Daddy, Survey Monkey and Question Pro. Lots of concepts and prototypes were created in order to map all the features and design a unique product that integrated with the other platform apps.</p>

<p>For the builder interface, I focused on a clean, 3-column layout that utilized a drag and drop feature to add questions to the survey. The right column acts as a dynamic options/settings panel that changes depending on the context or what is selected.
This consistency helps the user, allowing them to become familiar with a central location when adjusting or modifying options for campaign. Toggling between display and edit views, by allowing users to edit inline, improves the speed in which changes can be made and also eliminates additional form screens. When writing a question we decided to push the user to a new full screen.
This dedicated view focuses the user on one task – writing the question and answers. Again, the settings and options panel is in the same position, creating a familiar design pattern within the UI to aid the user.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h3>

<p>I left this project during the design exploration phase so unfortunately was unable to see it through to build and UAT. This project forced me to use a number of design methods and tools and is a good example of how these can be applied to work through problems and uncover possible solutions.</p>
