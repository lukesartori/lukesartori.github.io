<p>Mobile has redefined the way consumers interact in our world today and the idea of a physical product existing without some kind of digital representation is becoming increasingly more rare. This is what excites me as a designer and drives me to create exciting and engaging experiences that combine these two mediums perfectly.</p>

<p>Before UX and digital, I worked as an Industrial Designer creating physical objects. My approach to product design, regardless of the medium, remains the same. Researching, sketching, conceptualizing and testing are the main focus in my own design process and are the keys to identifying a productâ€™s end user but more importantly how and where they will be using it.</p>

<p>I believe that design led problem-solving and cross team collaboration are the keys to delivering a truly great product to market. Working with talented developers, visual designers, marketers and product owners has made me a better problem-solver, a well-rounded thinker and a more insightful designer.</p>
